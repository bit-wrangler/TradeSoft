Recommended to get the latest .NET Core SDK. (2.1.5 Used)

# Structure:

* **src/Core/Domain/Entities** - Domain entities: *Transaction*, *Fund*, *Investor*, *SalesPerson*
* **src/Core/Domain/Repositories** - Repository interfaces: *ITransactionRepository*
* **src/Core/Application** - Business app logic: *TransactionReporter*
* **src/Core/Application/Models** - Business app logic models: *SalesPersonSalesSummary*, *SalesPersonAUMSummary*, *InvestorShareImbalance*, *InvestorProfit*, *FIFOProfitCalculator*
* **src/Core/Application/Utilities** - Business app logic utilities / static tools: *ToDatePeriodUtility*
* **src/Infrastructure/Repositories/CSVTransactionRepository** - CSV based implementation of the repository/data source for the app
* **src/Presentation/TradeSoftConsole** - basic UI app to demonstrate the Application logic
* **test/manual** - sandbox area to mess around in, not considered as part of the solution
* **test/auto/Core/Application.Test** - some basic unit tests to check the app logic


The assumption is that this app would expand to some database driven solution. So the Fund, Investor, and SalesPerson domain entities were created instead of just having plain string properties in the Transaction entity.

**Usage:**
TradeSoftConsole.exe PATH_TO_TRANSACTIONS_CSV

It is assumed that the commands below are executed in the root folder of the repository (same level as the .sln file)

**To test:**
dotnet test

**To build:**
dotnet build

**To publish an executable:**
dotnet publish -c Release -r win-x64 src\Presentation\TradeSoftConsole\TradeSoftConsole.csproj

**To run the built binary on the test CSV file:**
bin\TradeSoftConsole.exe assets\Data.csv
